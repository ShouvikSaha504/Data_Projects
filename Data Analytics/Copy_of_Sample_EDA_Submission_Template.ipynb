        "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical phase in the data analysis process that plays a pivotal role in understanding and unraveling the insights within a dataset. In a nutshell, EDA is the art of visually and statistically summarizing, interpreting, and interrogating data sets to extract meaningful patterns, relationships, and trends. This process involves the use of various statistical and graphical techniques to transform raw data into actionable insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "By employing tools and libraries like Pandas and NumPy in Python, analysts can efficiently clean, preprocess, and explore data, unveiling its underlying structure and characteristics. EDA aids in identifying outliers, missing values, and potential patterns that inform subsequent modeling decisions. Furthermore, it facilitates the creation of informative visualizations, histograms, scatter plots, and more, enabling a comprehensive understanding of data distributions and correlations.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, EDA serves as the compass guiding analysts through the initial stages of data exploration, allowing them to make informed decisions, formulate hypotheses, and ultimately unlock the intrinsic value hidden within the data. Through this iterative and investigative approach, EDA empowers data professionals to embark on a data-driven journey, fostering a deeper understanding of the phenomena encapsulated in the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, we performed exploratory data analysis on the Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset which is in CSV format. Airbnb also known as an American online platform for rental accommodations is a platform that connects hosts and guests. Here hosts list their homes for rent then guests can discover and book those places. Airbnb, which launched its business in 2009, has experienced explosive growth by creating value through the sharing economy business model. The Airbnb business model helps property owners exploit underutilized assets. However, along with its rapid growth, controversies have arisen among many stakeholders, especially the traditional hotel industry, communities, and policymakers. Airbnb prominently argues to promote more inclusive forms of tourism by enabling ordinary households to occasionally share their home with tourists. This conventional understanding of ‘home-sharing’ has been challenged, however, with critics arguing that property owners and landlords use the platform for the commercial provision of permanent holiday homes.\n",
        "\n",
        "We used numpy, pandas library for data manipulation and data wrangling, and Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data visualization to gain insights from the given data. At the beginning of the EDA, we will perform pandas operations to know our data and gain information from the data. Then we will operate to understand the variables and check the unique values for each variable. After this step, we will move to the data-wrangling process to clean our data. Then we will perform data visualizations to plot the data and extract valuable insights. After analyzing the plots we will suggest what are the obstacles hindering the growth of the business and how to overcome them. We performed different visualizations like Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate analysis. Thus we will conclude our EDA project.\n",
        "\n",
        "Steps-\n",
        "1. First we will import pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries. Then we load the CSV data with pandas. Then we viewed the first and last five rows of the data frame, the shape of the data frame for a better understanding of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Then we will perform some steps to find duplicate values, missing values/ null values, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Then we will check for unique values for each variable in the data frame.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. In the next step we will start data wrangling for creating appropriate visualizations.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. After completing data wrangling we will perform visualizations with visualization libraries like matplotlib and Seaborn. Here we will plot the following plots - Bar plot, scatter plot, histogram, heatmap, pair plot, etc.\n"
